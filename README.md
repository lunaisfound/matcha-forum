<h2>üç∞ Problem</h2>

A New York Times‚Äô study in 2017 found out that The median family income of a student from DePauw is $144400 and 59% come from the top 20 percent. Less than 1% of students at DePauw came from a poor family but became a rich adult. Low-income students are often forced to work multiple jobs while the cost of living at DePauw continues to soar. Basic education necessities such as books calculators laptops..are unattainable for many people from this group. Some suffer from the constant pressure of paying their way through college while maintaining good grades while others live in fear of being ostracized by their classmates who are more well-off than they are.

<h2>  ü§ó Our Mission</h2>

   Stemmed from the very struggle of this underrepresented group, we created Matcha, a platform that aims to provide students with the resources necessary to continue their studies at DePauw.

   We want to tackle two main problems that contribute to the cost of studying at DePauw:

* Expensive school items: In many classes physical textbooks, although cost hundreds of dollars, are still mandatory. Not to mention websites‚Äô subscriptions, laptops, calculators,...Since only some students are able to pass down their stuff to friends and family members, the majority are being bought and thrown away at the same time. 

* Lack of guidance: College students are just baby adults, meaning they are still not able to grasp the ideal of good personal finance management. Therefore, they need some sort of support system that can answer their queries in case an issue arises.


  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Resources: Regularly update information on available scholarships non-profit organizations and their activities...
*   Forum: Students are free to discuss any topic related to finances management share tips ask for support or even tell their stories
*   Marketplace: To protect the environment and also help our students save their money the Marketplace aims to provide a platform where DePauw tigers can sell or trade second-hand goods. There sellers can post their items and buyers can contact them to purchase said items. The price ranges from free to whatever amount the seller wishes to set at.
